Proof-of-Concept AI demonstrating meta-cognition loops with automatic axiom generation to resolve numeric inconsistencies.

# Meta-Cognition + Axiom Generation PoC

This repository contains a minimal AI core simulation demonstrating meta-cognition (self-perception, logic loop diagnosis, self-feedback) along with axiom generation to resolve numeric inconsistencies.

## Features

- **Self-Perception Phase**: Encodes user input and intention.
- **Logic Loop Diagnosis Phase**: Checks for inconsistencies with previous responses.
- **Axiom Generation Phase**: Creates new axioms when numeric conflicts are detected.
- **Self-Feedback Phase**: Generates responses while monitoring logical integrity.

## Purpose

- To conceptually demonstrate meta-cognition in AI.
- Show how minimal AI cores can generate axioms for conflict resolution.
- Suitable for research, education, or PoC demonstrations.
